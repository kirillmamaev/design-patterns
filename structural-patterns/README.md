# Structural Patterns

These patterns deal with object composition, explaining how to combine objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically without altering their structure
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it
