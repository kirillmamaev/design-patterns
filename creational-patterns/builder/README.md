# Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.
This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with many optional parameters or when the construction process involves multiple steps that can vary independently of the object's representation.
