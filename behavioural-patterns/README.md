# Behavioural Patterns

These patterns focus on communication between objects and the distribution of responsibilities, ensuring effective collaboration and loose coupling.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
- **Mediator**: Defines how a set of objects interact with each other
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class
- **Visitor**: Separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate
