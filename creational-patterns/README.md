# Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in how objects are instantiated and improving code reusability.

- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it
