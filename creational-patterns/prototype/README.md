# Prototype

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.
It provides a way to instantiate objects without specifying their concrete classes, promoting flexibility and reusability in code.
